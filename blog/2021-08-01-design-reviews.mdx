title: Engineers in Design Reviews
---

Designs reviews are an opportunity to collaborate with design and product teams.
Full stack and Frontend engineers should work closely with these teams to
ensure high quality user experiences when building new features. Engineers can bring a valuable,
systems oriented perspective, to feature design review, since they have a deeper understanding of how technical
constraints and designs may impact delivery timelines and user experience.

## Engineering goals

To that end the engineer's role in a design review is specific and focused on goals that
play to our unique position as engineers. It is important to remember that as users-of-software
our UI/UX impressions are appreciated and valuable. However, it is not the primary goal of the
engineer to play devils advocate with design or product. Ultimately the designer **owns** the
responsibility of creating a UI to meet the needs of our users.
It is product's responsibility to understand our user's use cases, and the business needs and synthesize a product spec.
Engineering is responsible for delivering on the design and product spec producing high-quality, bug free, features that meet user needs.

### 1. Determine if the design can be built

As an engineer our primary input to design reviews is around the technical feasibility of a proposed design.
Feasibility is a spectrum. Most things _can_ be built but many things should _should not_ be. That is to say,
every design implies a set of technical tradeoffs. For instance, a design fighting web platform conventions,
may require extensive amounts of JavaScript to implement.

In these cases the engineer's job is to advocate for solutions that minimize technical complexity and
offer alternative design patterns that may provide similar UX but are easier to implement. Common examples of
this would be layouts that cannot be represented purely with CSS, behavior that would require a number of
new libraries to implement well, or designs that are not accessible.

### 2. Evaluate whether the design integrates and maintains consistency with existing code

As an implementor and steward of the frontend UI engineers should have a good view of the application UI as whole.
Understanding the patterns and components that are used throughout the frontend. As part of design reviews it is partly
the responsibility of the engineer to evaluate how a given feature will "slot" into the application.
We should invite questions around the shape of the new UI work: Does the design complicate the implementation or
UX of another feature? Does other upcoming work synergize with the design? Can the design system libraries be
extended easily or does the design challenge core assumptions? Does the interaction model necessitate specific
new APIs? The answers to these questions complicate timelines, resourcing and other engineering concerns so
it's best to understand them up front.

### 3. Help refine the product spec

As the shape of feature becomes more concrete, new details about requirements, behavior, and product needs surface.
Engineering should collaborate with design and product to ensure that thing in designs reconciles with the product spec.
Engineers should help surface product spec gaps implied by designs.
These are often around interactions that aren't necessarily clear or defined in a static Figma.
How does clicking through a UI update and change it and can we build that? Is there any Vet specific details that aren't covered?
Does UI behavior implies new or more complex API functionality or backend work?

### 4. Develop high level estimate of work

While product spec reviews provide initial opportunities for high level estimation, design reviews are a great opportunity to
sanity check and refine those estimates. Especially since scope and requirements tend to shift as the details become more
concrete. Note, that the goal is not to replace refinement/pointing sessions, but to build good "medium" resolution
estimates of the scope and size of the project.

## Playbook

To meet this goals what follows some practical avenues of investigation when interrogating a design. The goal is not
simply to accept or reject it. Instead we should contribute to the process of the balancing the wider set of
user needs, business requirements and engineering realities. Some features may warrant tradeoffs in performance
or engineering maintainability because the business needs outweigh the engineering cost.
Our job to clarify the realities and costs of those tradeoffs, and to surface feasible alternatives.

Use the following sets of questions as a guide.

### Can this design be built:

- Using features supported in our browser matrix?
- Would the implementation incur significant tech debt?
  - What would the plan be for paying it down?
  - Does the complexity leak to other application areas making it more error prone or harder to maintain?
- Accessibly?
  - Accommodates touch screens (most windows laptops have touch screens)
  - Designs are keyboard accessible, i.e. don't require a mouse. This is especially relevant for data input UI
- With good performance?
  - The web platform isn't great at everything, does the design work against the platform conventions resulting in a hard-optimize UX?
- With reasonable increases to bundle size, page load performance, and client-server communication
  - Will the UI hammer the server with significantly more requests or increase load substantially
  - Will a change require large amounts of new libraries or other dependencies?

### Is the design clear?

- Are the transitions between screens obvious, and addressable?
  - How will screen URLS work, can we represent this design with our frontend routing tools?
- How does the design respond to changes in window size, device form factors?
  - Is the example data representative? How does text overflow? How does content not fitting get handled?
- Are all their new interactions that are not covered by the designs.
  - e.g. new button variants need "hover", "active", and "disabled" styles.

### How much work will this take?

- Does this require new design system components?
  - Are they specced to the higher standard required for general UI components?
  - Are there existing similar patterns that could be used instead of building new ones?
- Does this require third party library or dependencies?
  - Are there tradeoffs with integrating, e.g. sometimes styling or branding is harder for off the shelf UI components.
- **Are there any small tweaks to the design that would significantly decrease the engineering complexity?**
