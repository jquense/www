## Philosophy

<div className="text-xl mb-1">Be Explicit </div>
<div className="text-xl">Be Pragmatic </div>

### Consistent

Code that is written consistently reduces cognitive load for developers. It eliminates
disagreement over things that do not make a difference to delivering high quality user-focused software.

Consistent (often rigid) application of decided patterns and styles makes a codebase
predictable. It makes it easier to navigate, empowers teammates to work in new areas and codebases,
and leaves more mental space for considering product, UX/UI and other business problems.

The reality is that codebases, especially large ones, are full of arbitrary choices and patterns:
folder structure, naming schemes, etc. It ultimately matters less what the "right" choice
is and more that it's made once and consistently applied. And (importantly) it's the
lack of exceptions to the rule that makes the code predictable.

### Explicit

Code that is explicit leaves no room for misinterpretation. It explains
and contextualizes itself by nature of its structure and naming. It enables
teammates to read code quickly and with less external resources.

Explicitness often means sacrificing short or "neater" names for ones that
state exactly what they are, sometimes with silly verbosity.

```tsx dosAndDonts
// Bad
const [idx, setIndex] = useState(0);

// Good
const [firstSelectedIndex, setFirstSelectedIndex] = useState(0);
```

Explicit code strives for clarity, not just in naming. Overly terse or "clever" code
can lack explicitiness insofar as it may defy expectation or intuition. We want to spend time understanding
complexity in business logic, not esoteric code styles. A classic example is the use of `Array.reduce` for
transforming objects.

```tsx dosAndDonts
// Bad
const parsedData = Object.keys(data).reduce(
  (next, key) => ({
    ...next,
    [key]: parseFloat(data[key]),
  }),
  {}
);

// Good
const parsedData = {};

for (const key of Object.keys(data)) {
  parsedData[key] = parseFloat(data[key]);
}
```

#### Exceptions to the rule

If an "implicit" name is universally understood,
as with a common language convention, it may be preferable. For instance: `idx` in a for-loop.
These cases are exceptions.

There are also cases where potentially unintuitive patterns
are so common in the broader JS ecosystem that it's worthwhile to match
these patterns. One example is using `Boolean` to filter out falsey values
from an array. As with naming, these exceptions should be explicitly documented.

```tsx
const compactArray = [new Date(), null, "", "James", undefined].filter(Boolean);
```

There is also a level of explicitness that is overly pedantic, either
because it's excessively verbose for minimal benefit or at the expense of clarity.

```tsx dosAndDonts
// Bad
if (typeof key === "undefined" && key === null) {
  throw Error("Key is required");
}

// Better
if (key !== undefined && key !== null) {
  throw Error("Key is required");
}

// Best
if (key == null) {
  throw Error("Key is required");
}
```

Checking for `undefined` and `null` using `===` is more explicit.
While in some sense "safer", the likelihood of `undefined` being
globally redefined (and not caught by linting) is extremely low.
The use of `==` with `null` to check for both `undefined` and `null` is so
common that the more explicit form invites more questions than `== null` does.

### Pragmatic

Pragmatism in code is about considering tradeoffs. It requires that we are grounded in the larger picture
of our work, that we understand what and _why_ we are writing code. To be Pragmatic in engineering is to
build the _appropriate_ thing, within the context of product requirements, user empathy, and technical constraints.

The goal of Pragmatic code is to balance the scales between delivering user value, quality software, while enabling
high velocity development. This may mean incurring technical debt to ship a feature as much as it will mean, slowing
down developement to build future-proof code, or avoid maintainance burdens later. Always consider the wider context
and think about how decisions may affect the team 6 months from now.
